# IP-Scanner

## Objective

 We will be using an IP scanner which is a software tool that discovers live devices/hosts on the network by scanning for active IP addresses. 


### Skills Learned

- Network familiarity
- Troubleshooting

### Tools Used

- Angry IP scanner 


## Steps
1. Google **Angry IP Scanner** and download the stand alone executable. You will have to download a separate installation of the 64-bit OpenJDK/Java 11+ first.
2. Once you have the Angry IP scanner open, it will dispaly the range of IP addresses within the network it will scan.
3. The network mask should be set to **/24**
4. Click **Scan**
5. The IP scanner will start scanning and will display a list of live hosts on the network indicated by the blue circle. Non-live hosts will be indicated by the red circle.
6. On this machine, there is only 1 live host.
The IP scanner tool is essential to managing a network and an inventory of hosts, as it confirms the number of hosts and may indicate any rogue computers on a network.
